# Task3-bank-marketing-decision-tree-classifier
In this project, we built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, based on demographic and behavioral data from the Bank Marketing dataset. The process included:

Data loading and preprocessing using Pandas and Label Encoding

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

Training the decision tree model using entropy as the criterion

Evaluating the model with accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix

Visualizing the decision tree using Matplotlib

The model provided valuable insights into how different attributes such as job, age, education, contact type, and campaign duration influenced customer decisions. This project not only demonstrates practical knowledge of machine learning but also shows the ability to derive actionable business insights from data.

‚úÖ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
‚úÖ Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
‚úÖ Dataset Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository ‚Äì Bank Marketing Dataset
‚úÖ Internship Provider: Prodigy InfoTech

üîç Outcome: Successfully predicted customer subscription behavior and visualized the decision-making process, improving interpretability for business applications.
